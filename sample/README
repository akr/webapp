This directory contains several example for webapp.

= Scripts

* hello.cgi       : hello-world cgi
* view-sqlite.cgi : web interface for SQLite database.  (needs config. to run.)

= How to Install

  % cd .../webapp/sample
  % make
  % mkdir ~/public_html/webapp-sample
  % cp cgi-bin/*.cgi ~/public_html/webapp-sample

The above "make" generates wrappers for each cgi scripts.
Since cgi-bin/*.cgi are just a wrapper, actual scripts in sample directory are
still required to run.

== FastCGI, mod_ruby

If your web server supports FastCGI or mod_ruby, sample scripts can be run
on them.

  % cd ~/public_html/webapp-sample
  % cp hello.cgi hello.fcgi
  % cp hello.cgi hello.rbx

Since webapp scripts can run under CGI, FastCGI and mod_ruby without
modification, just a cp is enough to setup.

== WEBrick

  % cd ~/public_html/webapp-sample
  % cp hello.cgi hello.webrick
  % ruby .../webapp/webapp/webrick-servlet.rb
