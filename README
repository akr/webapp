== Feature

* very easy-to-use API
* works under CGI, FastCGI and mod_ruby without modification
* works under WEBrick
  (WEBrick based server must require "webapp/webrick-servlet", though.)
* works as a standalone http server without modification
* works as usual command (CLI) for debugging and static content generation.
    xxx.cgi [options] [/path_info] [?query_string]
* path_info aware relative URI generation
* HTML form parameter validation by HTML form (sample/query.cgi)
* automatic Content-Type generation
* a web application can be used as a web site with WEBrick
  (URL will be http://host/path_info?query.
  No path component to specify a web application.)
* a response is gzipped automatically if the browser accepts.
* Last-Modified: and If-Modified-Since: support for usual files.

== Example

=== Hello World

The script follows works under CGI, FastCGI and mod_ruby without modification.
(Although it depends on web server configuration, the filename of the script
should be "hello.cgi", "hello.fcgi" or "hello.rbx".)

  #!/usr/bin/env ruby
  require 'webapp'
  WebApp {|webapp|
    webapp.puts "Hello World."
  }

The script also works under WEBrick based server such as follows.
In this case, the script filename should be "hello.webrick".

  require 'webapp/webrick-servlet'
  httpd = WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:DocumentRoot => Dir.getwd, :Port => 10080)
  trap(:INT){ httpd.shutdown }
  httpd.start 

The script also works as usual command.
It can be used for debugging and static content generation.

  % ./hello.cgi 
  Status: 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/plain
  Content-Length: 13

  Hello World.

The script also works as a standalone http server.

  % ./hello.cgi server
